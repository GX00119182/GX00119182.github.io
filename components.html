<h4>Design Principles in action:</h4>
<p>I feel that Usability was integrated into my website by designing with mobile-first methods which corresponds
with the accessability and availability principle of design. I feel it fulfills the principle of Learnability as 
it requires no complex operations to navigate the site, thus why I also feel it fulfills the principle of Clarity as
I have laid out the site in such a way that there is no vague tabs or information. I feel also that it fulfills the principle
of Relevance as per CA specification I have laid it out in the same manner as a CV would be presented on paper.</p>

<h4>In this CA i put theory to practice by implementing my assignment using the following Usability laws:</h4>
<li>The 3 Click Rule - all pages and sections on my website require no more than 3 clicks to view</li>
<li>Fitts Law - Every element of the website is appropriately laid out and there is nothinf that looks out of shape or out of place.</li>
<li>7+_ 2 Rule - The site has 9 elements in the navbar which are clickable and direct you to some part of the page.</li>
